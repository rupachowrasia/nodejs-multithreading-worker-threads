# Multithreading in node.js with Worker Thread
> Node.js is single-threaded by default (everything runs on the main thread), which is great for I/O tasks but bad for heavy computation (e.g., image processing, encryption, parsing large files). To offload heavy computational task we use 
Worker Threads in node.js.

## ðŸš€ Features

- A Worker Thread is a way to run JavaScript in parallel on multiple threads (useful for CPU-heavy tasks).
- They share memory, but donâ€™t spawn new processes.
- Ideal for CPU-bound tasks (math, compression, etc.) â€” not I/O-heavy work.
- API:
    - Run check: isMainThread
    - Send/Receive: parentPort.postMessage(), .on()
    - Input data:	workerData
    - File path: Use new URL('./worker.js', import.meta.url) in ESM
